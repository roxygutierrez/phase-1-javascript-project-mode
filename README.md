# Santa's Workshop

Phase 1 JavaScript Project

## Introduction

Christmas is around the corner and Santa needs help making presents in time for all the nice kids on his list!
Santa currently only has 5 elves working and they are not able to finish making all of the toys in time for Christmas! Add an elf to the roster so the kids can have their presents in time for Christmas morning!

### Project Requirements / Features

- A single page application (SPA)
- Application contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript and communicates with JSON server
- Contains a collection of 5 objects with 3 attributes and handles each asynchonously
- Contains 3 distinct event listeners using (`.addEventLister()` method)
- Implementation of array iteration to iterate through elves

#### Starting Up the Server

- To get started, fork and clone this to your local environment
- Run `npm install`
- All of Santa's current elves' data are stored in the db.json file. To access this data using the JSON server, run `json-server --watch db.json`.

##### Project Function

Santa requires more help in order to fulfill this years' Christmas delivery, this application contains a form that allows you to add an elf's name and image URL in order to hire an elf for Santa.
The more elves you add, the more toys Santa will be able to deliver!
If someone decides to sabotage Santa and add someone other than an elf (for example, The Grinch), the form will reject their submission.
